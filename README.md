## Description

Are you lacking a green thumb? Watching your house plants die in front of your eyes? 
We have the solution for you. Welcome to NeoPlants! 
The game where you grow your loveable plant on a screen. No messy dirt, water, or fertilizer involved. 
All you need to do is interact with your plant daily. 
Feed it, give it water, and play music. Each activity will give your plant life! 
But, beware, if you don't visit your plant regularly you will neglect it to death.
